I have a BSc in Physics from the University of Warwick and have been working in the ISP Networking and IT space for the last three years. I've decided to make a career transition to DevOps and Cloud Infrastructure, and have recently finished a DevOps bootcamp training with AiCore to help facilitate this. This is the start of my github repo. Welcome!
